# LeagueAutoAcceptPickBan
Automatically accepts your queue in League of Legends, then bans and picks your selected champions. Will select backup champion if your first pick is already banned/picked. You can choose your champion and backup champion at the bottom of autoaccept.py, and make sure to set your game path as well if it isn't already C:\Riot Games\League of Legends. Requires champions.txt in the same folder as script.
